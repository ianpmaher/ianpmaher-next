### The problem
Every September, I am asked by students which classes they ought to take. Some of them want different electives, and some just want to be with friends or a favorite teacher. But many, especially the upperclassmen, want to know which classes might boost their GPA the most. My own sense of what a GPA means is colored by my own experiences in school, especially college and later, graduate school. 

But collegiate and secondary school GPAs are computed differently, since courses are weighted in high school. More difficult classes, especially AP clases, are naturally given more weight than a class where a beating pulse is returned with an easy A.
