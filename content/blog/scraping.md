# Notes on JavaScript solutions for web scraping

While working on the [RI-API application](https://github.com/ianpmaher/ri-api), I found a roadblock. 
My new idea for a feature was having a list of restaurants. Rhode Island has some of the best food around, and there's always something new going on. I grew up in the millieu of the restaurant business, and I'm grateful to know my way around a menu. 

You can find dishes from many different cultures scattered throughout the state. Top of mind, you can find some of the more storied Italian restaurants in New England on Federal Hill in Providence.
