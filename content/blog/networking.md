### Computers: Back to Beginnings
Millennials grew up at a time when personal computers were becoming accessible, but not yet ubiquitous. I’ve long been grateful for the chance to learn primarily from books, play video games on devices dedicated to the purpose, and not to blur the two. Instead of Chromebooks in every class, my high school had a computer lab used every once in a blue moon. My college days were spent on a 15” MacBook Pro with a dual-core processor that still works.

All along the way, IT was in the background, making sure packets got delivered. Although I was a tech-savvy kid, sometimes I did need to bring my laptop to the Genius Bar, ask the Campus Help Desk about installing software, and so on.
